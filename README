PyGPG  is a python interface wrapper for gnupg's gpg command.  It runs gpg and
gathers data from gpg's outputs, making that data availabe to python code
consumers.

It aims to provide a very flexible, reliable and secure method to integrate
gnupg functionality into python programs.  It also has (IMHO) a very good,
flexible method of mining and making available all the data obtained from
gpg's status-fd messages.

What makes this wrapper work more flexibly is that it is very much config based
for runnning the gpg subprocesses.  The focus is not about providing a specific
python function for every action gpg is capable of.  GPG itself is very much
option based, so to that end so is this wrapper.  All that is needed is to
tweak the options to your liking, then runGPG() passing it your desired
action, and either text for stdin input or a filepath for it to process.

    So far there is a general runGPG() capable of almost any action gpg is
    capable of.  It is early in development, so have not tested all the
    actions.  There are a few other convience functions which in turn
    establish some parameters and call runGPG() for you.  They are decrypt,
    verify, sign.  There are also version and options properties which return
    the information gleaned from running gpg.

    Update: 20130706

    I've renamed the python pygpg pkg to pyGPG the same as the project
    name.  I did this for some consistency.  There is another pygpg project
    started at about the same time as this one.  It's python pkg is named gpg,
    so could be installed side by side with this one. It is different, and very
    limited in it's capabilities.

    There are a great many more task options available for gpg than I have added
    to the config.  I have onlt added some basic task options that I have tested
    myself.  You are welcome to add additional command options, test and send
    them in to me for inclusion.

    A more recent addition, is the ability for pyGPG to mine the colon listings
    data output by using the --with-colons option.  It places the data obtained
    into namedtuple classes just like the status_fd output.
